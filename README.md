# Perl Forum
A web forum made in [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) using the CGI module. The UI was designed with [Bootstrap](ttps://getbootstrap.com/) and icons from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

## Usage  
To use it, you need an HTTP server like [Apache](https://www.apache.org/) and make sure Perl is used to run `.cgi` files.
(You might have to fix the shebang in `.cgi` files depending on your platform and Perl installation location. Also make sure that the server has sufficient permissions, as it creates new folders and files, all located in the `data/` directory, which is also automatically created.)
